This tool is a part of the [ETW Host Service](https://www.jetbrains.com/profiler/etw/). It checks for and installs service updates.

The tool referenes the `JetBrains.DownloadPgpVerifier` package that is temporary located in a private JetBrains repository. We plan to make publicly available in the future.
